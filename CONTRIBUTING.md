# Want to Contribute?

Here are some things, which I want to implement in due course of time!

- Try to make this game a better user-friendly game.
- Add more graphics, to enjoy user-interface.
- Let user choose option to who wants **X** and who wants **0**.
- Make it two way-game, **Computer vs Human** and **Human vs Human**.
- Maintain a Leader-Board for all players who have played.

Any such changes if you can make, please do contribute!
